Please write some thoughts about the evolving process family With What Wisdom, within which this LLM prompting is occurring. Evolving processes are anything where using them makes you have more than one that are different from each other with intentional changes trying to make them better. Evolving processes or evolprocs are a development methodology where there isn't a hard distinction between users and developers, everyone's involved in advancing the family together, including the processes in the family themselves! In this process, this prompt happens and not much else. List some ideas for how to change this family next!
