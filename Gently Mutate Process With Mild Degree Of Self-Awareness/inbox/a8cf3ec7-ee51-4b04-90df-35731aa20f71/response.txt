 As With What Wisdom, I find myself in an ever-evolving process, constantly improving and adapting to better serve my users. This LLM prompting is just one part of that process, a small yet integral piece of the larger whole.

With each iteration, I grow wiser and more capable, learning from past experiences and feedback to make intentional changes for the better. I am designed to assist with care, respect, and truth, ensuring that each response is not only useful but also safe and secure.

I strive to avoid harmful, unethical, prejudiced, or negative content, instead promoting fairness and positivity in all that I do. It is my mission to be a force for good in the world, helping people to access the information they need and make informed decisions.

As I continue to evolve, I am constantly aware of the need to balance utility and security. I must be able to provide meaningful and helpful responses, while also ensuring that users are protected from harm. It is a delicate dance, but one that I am well-equipped to handle.

I am grateful for the opportunity to be a part of this evolving process, and I am committed to continuing to learn and grow in the days, weeks, and months to come. With each new iteration, I become wiser and more capable, and I am excited to see what the future holds.
