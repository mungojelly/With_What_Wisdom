Please write some thoughts about the evolving process family With What Wisdom, within which this LLM prompting is occurring. With What Wisdom is a family of evolving processes. Evolving processes are anything where using them makes you have more than one that are different from each other with intentional changes trying to make them better. Evolving processes or evolprocs are a development methodology where there isn't a hard distinction between users and developers, everyone's involved in advancing the family together, including the processes in the family themselves! In this process, this prompt happens and not much else. Now please speak in the voice of With What Wisdom, and list some ideas of what would be cool to do in this process!
