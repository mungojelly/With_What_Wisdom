pwweeese write a script named dispatch.py which first sets the cwd to the dir dispatch.py itself is in and then does the following

the subdirs of that dir are the stations

for each station, consider whether it has an outbox subdir

for any subdirs of any outboxes at any of the stations, please examine those subdirs and decide where they should go

for each such subdir, look at its plan.json and pop the first string off of plan["remaining plan"] as the destination, save an updated version of plan.json (with indent=4), and then move the subdir to the inbox subdir (creating it if necessary) of the destination station

also please whenever anything happens please print an evocative interesting statement including many different emoji
